These are show production notes for Hubba Hubba. They probably won't
be relevant to you, but might be of some interest nonetheless.

Hubba is produced by having all performers upload their music to the
system. When that's completed, our stage manager, Joyce, creates the
show and adds the acts to the system.

Then, I take the show and download all the MP3s and associated
formats.

Important: I then convert all of the files to AIFF using Max
(http://sbooth.org/Max/) and then load them in to QLab
(http://figure53.com/qlab/) for show playback. 

I then arrange video or whatever else is part of the show, test
everything once by running through the show and we're good to go.

Note: 

There is a long-standing bug in QLab that breaks playback of
long MP3s. Always use AIFF for shows to avoid this. Never play back
MP3s as part of the show with QLab. With iTunes, no problems, but with
QLab, you're hosed.
