Please note that `rvm ruby ...` is only an alias to `rvm do ruby ...`,
 it might work different as in earlier versions of RVM and will be shortly removed!
 Also note that you do not have to prefix every command with `rvm`, they should just work by itself.
`rvm do ruby script/rails ser` is deprecated, use `rvm all do ruby script/rails ser` or `rvm 1.9.2 do ruby script/rails ser` instead.
