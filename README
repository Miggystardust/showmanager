Tested under passenger, nginx, ruby 1.9.2, and mongoDB 2.0.7-rc0

This project is largely based on rails3-mongoid-devise for authentication.

Installation procedure:

1) Start up Mongo locally on standard ports
2) Adjust config/environments as needed for your environemnt
3) In the app's root dir, do a 'bundle install' to install all the gems. 
4) Start the app under either ruby script/rails server, nginx+passenger, or apache+passenger.

Configuring a webserver to work with Rails is beyond the scope of this
documentation. You should consult the appropriate sites and Phusion
Passenger documentation.

To make someone an admin:

u = User.where(email: "jna@retina.net")[0]
u.admin = true
u.save!

Obviously, you'll need one of these.
