  <h2>Welcome to the Hubba Hubba show manager. </h2>
  <p>
    The Hubba show manager allows you to upload content for your act
    and for our stage manager and tech team to prepare the show. We'll 
    keep your music around forever (or until you tell us to remove it!) 
    and you'll never have to deal with plastic CD's ever again.
  </p>
  <h3>We're better than CDs!</h3>
  <P>
	The show manager accepts music, video, and images. Once you've uploaded your content, you won't ever have to upload it again.
