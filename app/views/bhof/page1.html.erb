<h3>Welcome to the BHOF 2015 Application System</h3>

  <div class="panel-body">

    <p>This online application consists of four parts, with EVERYTHING due by electronic submission at
      <strong><span class="rulepageheaders"><?php echo $deadline_with_time;?> </span></strong>This year's application is
      a bit shorter than last year's. If you have your act and video link ready, the application can be done in less
      than an hour. </p>

    <p>
      <strong>As with last year, we're offering a $10 discount on the application fee if you
        do parts 1 and 2 (the quick parts) early!</strong></span> We want you to spend time on the application and not
      rush. And also to have time to make changes if you need to. To encourage this, we're offering this discount if you
      do the first two parts early, which should take no more than ten minutes. Once you've paid it, you can still have
      until <?php echo $deadline_abbrev;?> to complete the rest of your application and fully submit it. The discount
      cutoff dates are December 15th (SUPER earlybird) and January 6th (regular earlybird). You'll see more info on that
      once you start the application.</p>

    <p>The four parts of the application are: 1) QUICK basic info (estimated 5-10 minutes); 2) Payment of application
      fee
      (3 minutes); 3) Additional info about the act (15-45 minutes); and 4) Legal agreement and online submission of the
      application (3 minutes).
      <strong class="rulepageheaders">To get the earlybird discount: just complete parts 1 and 2 early. Then you can
        work
        on the rest and submit it all by <?php echo $deadline_abbrev;?>.</strong></p>

    <p>And as before, we're planning to offer applicant-only presale tickets at the largest discount of the year, so
      don't
      miss out on your chance to get the best seats at the best price by submitting an application! </p>

  <strong>   Yes, I understand about the final due date, the earlybird payment
    discount, and that even if I pay early I have until <?php echo $deadline_abbrev;?> to submit the application.
