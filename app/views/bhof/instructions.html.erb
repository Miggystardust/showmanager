<h2>for completing the application</h2>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<blockquote>
  <h3><strong>1. Who should complete the application: </strong></h3>
</blockquote>
<ol>
  <ul>
    <ul>
      <li>If you're interested in performing or competing at <%=BHOF_TITLE%>, you're in the right place!
        <strong>If you're a Legend and are interested in performing on Legends night, you don't need to complete this
          application-- </strong>instead, just email the Legends team at
        <a href="mailto:legends@burlesquehall.com">legends@burlesquehall.com</a> and they will follow up with you.
      </li>
      <li> Each act or performing entity (for example, you or your group) must have
        a Main Contact Person (&quot;MCP&quot;) with an account on this system who
        is responsible for completing and submitting this application.
      </li>
      <li><strong><span class="highlight">Updated for 2015:</span></strong> Each account allows for multiple acts to be submitted, up to these limits: each performing entity (a soloist or group) can submit up to two acts. So for example, if you are a solo performer, you can submit one or two acts. If you are the leader of a group, you can submit one or two acts for your group. If you are both (a soloist and you have a group) you can submit one or two solo acts and one or two group acts, but not more than two for either category.
      </li>
      <li> Solo applicants must be the MCP for their solo act; but they do not have
        to be the Main Contact Person for a group entry they are a part of. (Example:
        Minnie Mouse is applying as a solo act, and is also part of the Disney Troupe.
        She must complete the application for her own act, but either she or Mickey
        or any other member of the group can have an account and be the MCP for
        the group entry.)<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</ol>

  <h3 ><strong>2. Completion of online entry form:</strong></h3>

<ol>
  <ul>
    <ul>
      <li><strong><span class="highlight">Updated for 2015:</span></strong> For 2015, we've made the site mobile-friendly.</li>
      <li> Complete each linked section shown for each account.</li>
      <li> You can save each page individually as you go and return later to finish
        or edit.
      </li>
      <li> Be sure to save frequently, and use the &quot;log out&quot; button when
        you are done.
      </li>
      <li> You can save each page in progress without filling out all the fields;
        but to finally submit the application, all fields must be complete. There is a table indicating if each section is complete
        or not. The system is designed to not allow submission of incomplete applications. Note that the chart shows each section as &quot;complete&quot; only if there is information entered in all fields; it doesn't check for accuracy or content of those fields.<br>
      </li>

  <h3 ><strong>3. Application fee: </strong></h3>
  <ul>
    <ul>
      <li>There is no cost to create an account or begin an application. The only
        fee is a $39 application fee that must be paid before you can submit a completed application. We do offer a $10
        discount for early payment &emdash; (by January 5th). Once paid, you can still have until January 19th to complete and submit the
        application:
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="highlight"><strong>*Super Earlybird* - Payment before December 15, 2014</strong> </span>11:59pm
          PST: <strong><span class="highlight">$29; 50% refundable</span></strong> if you end up not submitting the
          application
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="highlight"><strong class="highlight">*Earlybird* - Payment between December 16, 2014 and January
            5, 2015 </strong></span>11:59pm PST: <strong><span class="highlight">$29; nonrefundable</span></strong></li>
        <li><strong><span class="highlight">Payment after January 5, 2014</span></strong>, 12:00am PST until application
          deadline: <strong><span class="highlight">$39; nonrefundable</span></strong></li>
      </ul>
      <li><strong><span class="highlight">Updated for 2015:</span></strong> One of the sections on the main application dashboard is a PayPal link
        to pay the application fee. You can do that at any time while you are working
        on your application. The payment will be credited to the application it is intiated from.
      </li>
      <li>The discount deadlines apply to all acts, including the second act submitted (if submitted at all). The system
        does not allow for an additional second-act discount beyond that.<br>
      </li>
      <li><strong><span class="highlight">Updated for 2015:</span></strong> If you are submitting multiple acts, the payments do not have to be made at the same time, but the discount is applied (or not) based solely on payment date. For instance, if you are submitting two acts and pay both on January 4th, the fee will be $29 for each one. However, if you pay one on January 4th at $29 and then wait until January 15th to pay the second one, the second one will be at the $39 rate.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <h3 ><strong>4. Submission of completed application and deadline:</strong></h3>
  <ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Once all sections are complete (including the payment), you will be able
        to officially submit the application electronically. Your online account will be updated to show that your application has been submitted.
      </li>
      <li>The deadline for all applications is <strong class="highlight">11:59pm PST on January 19, 2015</strong>.
        This online system will not allow submissions after that. We recommend aiming
        to finish your application ahead of time just in case.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <h3 ><strong>5. Notification:</strong></h3>
  <ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Upon electronic submission of your application, you can log in to see
        your application status. We expect that final notifications will not be
        available until March 2015 or later (if necessary). All notifications
        will be online via this system-- you can log into your account after that
        date to see your status. We will announce on the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/bhofweekend">Facebook page</a>
        and via email to all applicants when decisions are ready.
