  We've previously published
    <a href="http://blog.bhofapplication.com/behind-the-scenes-the-competition-selection-process" title="article about the BHOF selection process" target="_blank">an
    article</a> describing the selection and judging
    process in detail. The process is fairly straightforward, but you may be
    interested to read that! As for specific judging criteria: if you're
    asking yourself <em>&quot;which act(s) should I submit?&quot;,</em> here's what we're looking for:

  <p>The Burlesque Hall of Fame is dedicated to showcasing the most
    exciting, entertaining, innovative, fun, sexy and/or hilarious
    burlesque acts from all over the world. Those qualities in your
    own body of work are what you should have in mind when you select
    the act(s) you want to submit.
  </P>
  <P>
    As we did in 2014, we're allowing each soloist (or group) to
    apply with up to two acts. We really want to showcase a diversity
    of acts, and we want to re-emphasize that you don't have to be a
    certain style (or a certain anything) in order to perform,
    compete, or win a title at the Weekender. </strong></p>
  </p>
  <p>Generally speaking-- we are looking for acts that are ready to dazzle on the
    big stage. Note that &quot;ready to dazzle on the big stage&quot; has a lot
    of latitude: we have seen videos filmed in a living room that &quot;bring it,&quot;
    and we've also seen professionally-shot videos that weren't as dazzling.
    It's not always easy to compare different types of acts (e.g. comedy vs. classic
    elegance vs. high glitz) but the best acts always have that <em>special something</em>:
    we want to see that during your time onstage, you can <em>completely own it</em>--
    the stage, the audience, and the entire venue. A good place to start is by asking yourself, &quot;is THIS ready for
    the BIG STAGE?&quot;</p>

  <p>For 2015, we are going to continue to offer options for both competitive and noncompetitive
    spots; either way, your act should still have this &quot;special something&quot;
    mentioned above. More on that below.</p>

  <p>Note: because we allow solo applicants to also be part of group applications,
    it is possible that a performer will be accepted under both categories, providing
    that both their solo act and group act do well enough in the selection
    team's evaluation. </p>

  <h3 class="rulepageheaders">
    <span class="rulepageheaders"><strong>The overall evaluation</strong></span><strong>:</strong></h3>
    <p><strong>The act is what counts. Because we are,
      first and foremost, evaluating the <em>acts</em> that are being submitted, the
      act (and video) are by far the most important part of the evaluation. </strong>
      The short answers in the application are there to help the Selection Team get a better feel for
      your (and/or your group's) personality and flavor but don't factor into the evaluation. (This is also indicated
      within the application.) We do aim to include acts
      from across a wide range of styles and geographical areas, providing they have
      that &quot;special something&quot; described above.
      To be fair to all acts submitted, special consideration is <em>not</em> granted
      for having competed before, volunteering for the <em>BHOF</em>,
      having a particular style or appearance, who you &quot;are&quot; in the burlesque community, whether you submitted
      the application earlier than anyone else, etc. We give full and equal consideration to
      each and every act submitted, and the evaluation is strictly of the act and how the selection team perceives it
      will translate to the big stage.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>A note about competitive vs. showcase spots, and how this
      preference may or may not factor in to evaluations:</strong> we understand that different perfomers have
      different preferences as to performing competitively, noncompetitively, or either. Thus we offer the option to
      designate this preference. The &quot;special something&quot; and evaluation criteria described
      on this page will be the same for all of these.
      <strong>Acceptance rates will depend on the number of spots available
        and the number of applicants who designate their preference for each of these broad categories. Your application
        will be evaluated against the others, so indicating a preference for one or the other will
        <span style="font-weight: bolder; font-style: italic;">not</span> increase your chance of being offered a spot
        in that category by virtue of removing yourself from the other category.
        You should select the option-- competition, showcase, or either-- that matches what you would be happy with.
      </strong></p>

    <p><strong><span class="rulepageheaders">How acceptance into one spot affects other spots: </span></strong>if you
      indicate &quot;either&quot; (for competitive vs. not), you'll (of course!) receive equal consideration for both.
      But you can only perform the act once during the Weekend. So for instance: if your act is offered a spot in one
      show (e.g. competition), then you will not be offered a spot in the other (e.g., showcase). However, we do offer a
      few alternate spots in the event of cancellations, and so it's possible in that case to switch from one to the
      other. For example, it's possible to be an alternate for one night yet still be offered a spot for the other
      night. Or it's possible to be an alternate for one night and <em>not</em> be offered a spot for the other. Your
      notification will describe it in detail.</p>

    <p><strong><span class="rulepageheaders">A note about showcase theme:</span></strong> Since 2011, our showcase theme
      has been &quot;Movers, Shakers, and Innovators.&quot; We reserve the right to either keep this theme or change it
      based on the makeup of the pool of applications. </p>
  <p><strong>Judging criteria:</strong></p>
    <p>Below
      is an overview of judging criteria for the 2015
      Weekend competition. Please refer to these guidelines when deciding which of your
      routines you would like to bring to the Weekend. <strong>For the sake of continuity
      (and to help you plan your act submission), these guidelines/criteria serve
      for both the selection of performers (competitive and non-competitive) from
      all applicants, as well as the final competitive judging during the Weekend.
      However, the people on the Selection Team and the final Event Judges will be
      different sets of people. </strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Style, including but not limited to &quot;Overall
        Glamour&quot;:</em></strong> <br>
        This applies to your overall execution, stage makeup, accessories, hair, etc.
        <strong>Three things to note about this: </strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Overall Glamour doesn&#8217;t so much demand conventional beauty, but
          more attention to detail and general theatricality of your look. We want
          to see your personal style shine through!
        </li>
        <li>Costume is very important, but it does <em>not </em>necessarily have to
          be expensive and extravagant. The focus is on dance/performance/movement/creativity/personal
          presence, and for this you shouldn't have to break the bank.
        </li>
        <li>No matter what else your act contains, it should include at least some
          amount of clothing removal!
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p><strong><em>Poise, Polish and Professionalism:</em></strong> <br>
        This means smoothness of performance, including handling malfunctions or other
        unpredictable issues. </p>

      <p><strong><em>Stage Presence, Charisma and Energy:</em></strong><br>
        Judges will be looking for your passion for the art&#8212;something that should
        shine through in your routine, regardless of poise or polish.</p>

      <p><strong><em>Originality and Creativity:</em></strong> <br>
        Bring it on! The judges are all connoisseurs of both old and new burlesque,
        so don&#8217;t be afraid to express yourself (within PG-13 boundaries, that
        is).</p>

      <p><strong><em>Striptease Expertise</em></strong><em>:</em><br>
        Striptease is one of the most unique theatrical elements in burlesque. Judges
        will consider whether the way you remove your costume pieces is well-executed--
        whether it is done skillfully, inventively, and with exceptional ingenuity,
        humor, mischief, and/or sensuality.</p>

      <p><strong><em>Movement or Dance Ability:</em></strong><br>
        Not necessarily classical training, but more a pleasure to watch.</p>

      <p><strong><em>Entrance to and Exit from Stage:</em></strong><br>
        Don&#8217;t forget that first and last impressions count! Does the act feel
        complete, from beginning to end?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <h3 class="rulepageheaders"><strong>Some extras:</strong></h3>
    <p><strong><em>Community Spirit and other awards:</em></strong><br>
      At the Pageant, we may award additional awards (at our discretion) such as
      a &quot;community spirit&quot; award, &quot;most classic&quot;, &quot;most
      comical&quot;, etc. These are additional awards on top of crowning a winner
      in each of the four main categories. The potential of receiving these &quot;bonus&quot;
      awards does not factor into the application evaluation; these awards are intended
      to recognize additional excellence in an already excellent field.</p>

    <p><strong><em>Knowledge of Burlesque and The Burlesque Hall of Fame</em></strong><em>:</em><br>
      This isn't a &quot;judging criterion&quot;, but if you win a title, you become
      a de facto ambassador for The Burlesque Hall of Fame &amp; Weekender, so familiarity
      with burlesque/burlesque history is always good. For 2015, we will continue to ask that the
      performer crowned Reigning Queen of Burlesque either produce or host at
      least one benefit for the BHoF, locally or nationally, within one year of
      winning their title. There's no penalty for not doing so, but it is something
      we hope you will consider doing during your reign.</p>
