Too embarassing -- Rails4 breakage

* Dependent deletes might be fucked up (removed the deps from models)
* Dependent Acts are not loading right.

SECURITY

- Should probably offer the ability to disable the download box to
  prevent us being used as a warez/free music site


From Mig / BHOF:  11/21/2014
----------------------------------
Since the paypal now links to the application, we no longer need them
to do part 1 first. You can remove that restriction and button label.

Buttons look like they're clickable on mouseover, but they don't open anything.

"How the selection process works" should be target="_blank" (I could
put this in but already submitted an edit that hasn't been merged yet) - DONE

Not critical, but for extra glory: clicking name of application could 
take you to apps/123456789/edit screen - DONE

New act entry page:
Make "Act type" the top (first) field, so that the fields below it change. - DONE

Change label of "act name" to "performer or group name". (Or for extra
glory, "performer name" or "group name" depending on what they chose
for Act Type) - DONE but not with extras... 

When Act Type = Group, the "category" field should be hidden. - DONE
and logic fixed

Explanatory text for "Performer names" field: Please list a legal name
and stage name for each performer. For instance: Jennifer Doe (Creamy 
Cupcakes), Bruce Wayne (Batman) - DONE

Add a bit of vertical white space below the buttons at the bottom? - DONE

Payment page:

I got an error when paying. Attached. I was going to make an actual
transaction but it didn't go through. - TBD

Act technical information:

Should include the "heads up, this needs to be complete" part at the 
top. - DONE
