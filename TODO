To make someone an admin:

u = User.where(email: "jna@retina.net")[0]
u.admin = true
u.save!


Obviously, you'll need one of these.

Show system
- add intermissions

- header/footer

- "Cast" notes / sound / tech etc...

- Should output a really nice pdf like thing that looks like current sheets

- needs to be able to reorder the show.

- needs to be able to add 'acts' that are not part of the system! important.

- should auto compute time

- Extract Mp3 data via tagging...


- Allow download of entire thing as a zipfile.

It would be fucking awesome if we could make this a LIVE SCREEN, accessible from ipad.

like...

 [^]  [v]    START_TIME DURATION "DJ Netik: to close"
 [^]  [v]    START_TIME DURATION INTERMISSION 
 [^]  [v]    START_TIME DURATION DJ Netik: to close

So maybe we have a "kind" field that tells us what this is (note, act, etc.)

Compute that from assets.
