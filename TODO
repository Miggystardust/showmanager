To make someone an admin:

u = User.where(email: "jna@retina.net")[0]
u.admin = true
u.save!


Obviously, you'll need one of these.

DONE
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Show system
- add intermissions (DONE)
- "Cast" notes / sound / tech etc... ( DONE ) 
- Should output a really nice pdf like thing that looks like current sheets (maybe CSS print mode...) (PUTOFF)
  But ideally, fuck printing. We want this to be on ipads! 
- use ajax-- It would be fucking awesome if we could make this a LIVE SCREEN, accessible from ipad. (DONE, but want a read-only screen for ipads on /show) (DONE)
- needs to be able to reorder the show. (DONE)
- should auto compute time (DONE)
- Extract Mp3 data via tagging... (DONE)

Remaining work
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Allow download of entire thing as a zipfile.

Facebook Auth:

- If user auths with facebook they should not see password fields on profile page

Printing: 

- Need to write a screen for printing the show - current system does not have any CSS
  for printers, this sucks.
- header/footer

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BUGS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- There might be bugs in row-reordering I can't tell. 
- Want to be able to edit a notes field after the fact, you can't.
- Want to be able to show and edit act durations on edit page
