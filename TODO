To make someone an admin:

u = User.where(email: "jna@retina.net")[0]
u.admin = true
u.save!


Obviously, you'll need one of these.

Show system
- add intermissions (DONE)
- header/footer
- "Cast" notes / sound / tech etc... ( DONE ) 
- Should output a really nice pdf like thing that looks like current sheets (maybe CSS print mode...) (PUTOFF)
  But ideally, fuck printing. We want this to be on ipads!

- Extract Mp3 data via tagging... (DONE)

BUGS

- There might be bugs in row-reordering I can't tell. 
- Want to be able to edit a notes field after the fact, you can't.
- Want to be able to show and edit act durations on edit page
