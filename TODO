Remaining work
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Try to make notes more readable on edit show and show display fields - P3

EXTRA:

- Multi-asset support
  - Need ability to upload more than one song, more than one  P3

- Allow download of entire thing as a zipfile.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BUGS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- There might be bugs in row-reordering I can't tell. 

- Want to be able to edit a notes field after the fact, you can't.

- Time fields need to be larger, they are squished

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECURITY
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Should probably offer the ability to disable the download box to
  prevent us being used as a warez/free music site

DONE
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
