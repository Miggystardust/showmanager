Too embarassing -- Rails4 breakage

* Dependent deletes might be fucked up (removed the deps from models)
* Dependent Acts are not loading right.

SECURITY
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Should probably offer the ability to disable the download box to
  prevent us being used as a warez/free music site

Payment page:

I got an error when paying. Attached. I was going to make an actual
transaction but it didn't go through. - TBD

Act technical information:

TROUPES
--------

. Revisit entire troupe membership system and replace join/add screens - fixed
. Tag all relevant models with troupe or user ID relationship - but which ones? 
. Fix email sending and receiving such that we can send invites
.. build invite system and make it work w/ crypto + signing

What exactly is a troupe anyway? What does our changelist look like? 

1. Must be able to create a show inside of a troupe, that's a must.  (so on show creation we ask them to pick a troupe.)
2. Must be able to add users to the troupe. 
2a. When they are part of your troupe then you can see their acts, files, and people. 

Monetization
------------
. Bill for usage (where? What is billing?)
.. More than N in group? Ability to schedule show? Trial period? What?
.  $29/mo? drop prices like wow ($9.99/mo for 1year...)

FUTURE
-----
. Integration with QLab; Disassemble one of their plists and reverse-engineer
. Talk to figure53
. Stage plots?
