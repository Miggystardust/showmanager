------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Remaining work
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Major changes: Enable multi-tenant. That is, multiple shows and access rights.
- Log in, create a troupe. Assign a unique url to that troupe...

- Try to make notes more readable on edit show and show display fields - P3

- make emegency message float?


EXTRA:

- Multi-asset support
  - Need ability to upload more than one song, more than one  P3

- Allow download of entire thing as a zipfile.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BUGS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- There might be bugs in row-reordering I can't tell. 

- Want to be able to edit a notes field after the fact, you can't.

- Time fields need to be larger, they are squished

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECURITY
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Should probably offer the ability to disable the download box to
  prevent us being used as a warez/free music site

From Devon:

When an act is flagged, reset the act start-time to *now*, bump
subsequent act times up accordingly.  or perhaps one press to arm the
act as "ready" (yellow), and second press to indicate that the act has
begun (green), which updates schedule times.  probably would need a
disarm button, or maybe a "pause" button that colors it pink for
things like "performer is pooping" or "can't find CD" - or maybe tie
into emergency message?

TODO: User Role Access System...
User levels: admin/director/stage-manager - full control stage crew
sound, lights, stage manager, etc) - can emergency message, can flag
current act, play music (if that gets added) performer - can view
show, can cancel self

TODO: This needs a ton of thought to make this work correctly...

Shows should have groups and users.  Venue staff would just be another
group.  band or troupe is just a group.  Group has many users event
has many groups and users, so hubba would be a group, and DNA_crew
would be a group.  or Covenant_2012tour would be a group and DNA_crew
would be a group.  Might want to be able to also remove users from a
show, like say Hubba group is added to a show, but not all performers
from the hubba family are performing.  Or maybe DNA_crew has Jeremy,
Cy, and Steen, but only one of them is working.  probably not
necessary, but maybe it might be useful.

TODO: Venue - really just need: address, website, maybe contact person this
would mainly be for performers to see where the show is, etc.  Bonus
points for google map link


TODO: Far future feature...
Might also want to think about a string of events, for tours or
run-of-shows.  and with that probably some way to apply "current
cluster of users, groups, and removed-from-group-for-this-show users.
probably handled best by doing something like "copy this event X times
with current settings, then manually set date/location as needed.
Maybe even have "push this change to subsequent shows in the
string-of-shows.  like performer gets injured and drops out of
subsequent shows - one click update all shows.

might also want to add contracts, riders, etc. eventually.  perhaps
just link to shared google docs?

extra bonus points for calendar export - i.e. an ical feed of all the
shows *you* are working

Edit Show Schedule -- Dragging the acts around doesn't work in that
the order doesn't stick. I tried to start from the top down and drag
the first act from the bottom to the top. Then drag the second act
below the first one. But somehow, by the time I get to the the fourth
act, the order is messed up, the second act is back on the bottom!

TODO: I also want to suggest the ability for me to build an act FOR them,
maybe a pulldown menu with all available users to share editing
capabilities?

TODO: When I'm in the Show Schedule page, it would be helpful when after
pressing Update after editing an act to have the page return to the
Show Schedule page. Otherwise, it's resulting in a lot of running back
and forth between Show Schedule page, edit act, update, shows, edit.

TODO: In Show Schedule, please make the column for time narrower and the
next column for Act wider.

TODO: When performers enter length of act, change the copy to indicate that
they should round up to the minute. Had a performer (Bombshell) ask
why she can't enter 2:17.

TODO: The sound column looks funky if there's no artist meta data
attached, there's extra space on top. Maybe the CUE should be first,
then music selection below that?

Won't fix: When I go to edit an act, the line breaks that I enter need to show
up, it makes it easier to read as opposed to having all text be in one
paragraph.
