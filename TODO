To make someone an admin:

u = User.where(email: "jna@retina.net")[0]
u.admin = true
u.save!


Obviously, you'll need one of these.
------------------------------------------------------------

Show system
- add intermissions
- header/footer
- "Cast" notes / sound / tech etc... ( DONE ) 
- Should output a really nice pdf like thing that looks like current sheets (maybe CSS print mode...) (PUTOFF)
  But ideally, fuck printing. We want this to be on ipads! 
- use ajax-- It would be fucking awesome if we could make this a LIVE SCREEN, accessible from ipad.
- needs to be able to reorder the show.
- should auto compute time
- Extract Mp3 data via tagging... (DONE)
- Allow download of entire thing as a zipfile.

like...

 [^]  [v]    START_TIME DURATION "DJ Netik: to close"
 [^]  [v]    START_TIME DURATION INTERMISSION 
 [^]  [v]    START_TIME DURATION DJ Netik: to close

So maybe we have a "kind" field that tells us what this is (note, act, etc.)

Compute that from assets.
