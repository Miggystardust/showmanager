showmanager
===========

This is a Rails3 based show manager that manages assets for the Hubba Hubba Burlesque show. 

It's based largely on rails3-mongo-devise.

It requires MongoDB and Ruby 1.9.2.

It's also not ready for public use, so if I were you, I wouldn't bother downloading it just yet!
I'm keeping files here for my own use.
